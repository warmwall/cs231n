1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay, so let me dive into some
administrative

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,900
points first. So again, recall that
assignment 1 is due next Wednesday.

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,050
You have about 150 hours left,
and I use hours because there's a more

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,320
imminent sense of doom and remember that
a third of those hours you'll be

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,278
unconscious, so you don't have that much
time. It's really running out. And you

6
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:31,768
know you might think that you have
late days and so on but these assignments just get

7
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:38,640
harder over time so you want to save
those and so on, so start now. Let's see. So

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,109
there's no office hours or anything like
that on Monday. I'll hold make up office

9
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,839
hours on Wednesday because I want you
guys to be able to talk to me about the

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,260
especially projects and so on, so I'll be
moving my office hours from Monday to

11
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,820
Wednesday. Usually I had my office hours
at 6PM. Instead I'll have them at 5PM

12
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:59,909
and usually it's in Gates 260 but now
it'll be in Gates 259, so minus 1 on both and yeah

13
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,429
and also to note, when you're going to be
studying for midterm that's coming up in

14
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:04,170
a few weeks

15
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,109
make sure you go through the lecture
notes as well which are really part of

16
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,819
this class and I kind of pick and choose
some of the things that I think are most

17
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:13,579
valuable to present in a lecture but
there's quite a bit of, you know, more material

18
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:16,548
to be aware of that might pop up in the
midterm, even though I'm covering some of

19
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:19,610
the most important stuff usually in the lecture,
so do read through those lecture

20
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:25,618
notes. They're complimentary to the lectures.
And so the material for the midterm will be

21
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:32,269
drawn from both the lectures and the notes. Okay.
So having said all that, we're going to

22
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:36,769
dive into the material. So where we are
right now, just as a reminder, we have

23
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:39,989
the score function, we looked at several
loss functions such as the SVM loss

24
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:44,359
function last time, and we look at the
full loss that you achieve for any

25
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:49,379
particular set of weights on, over your
training data, and this loss is made up of

26
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,509
two components. There's a data loss and
a regularization loss, right. And really what we want to do

27
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:57,200
is we want to derive out the gradient
expression of the loss function with respect to the

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,118
weights and we want to do this so that
we can actually perform the optimization

29
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:07,069
process. And in the optimization process we're doing
gradient descent, where we iterate evaluating

30
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:11,030
the gradient on your weights, doing a
parameter update and just repeating this

31
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,259
over and over again, so that we're
converging to

32
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,929
the low points of that loss function and
when we arrive at a low loss, that's

33
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,799
equivalent to making good predictions
over our training data in terms of the

34
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:25,030
scores that come out. Now we also saw
that are two kinds of ways to evaluate the

35
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,019
gradient. There's a numerical gradient
and this is very easy to write but it's

36
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:32,840
extremely slow to evaluate, and there's
analytic gradient, which is, which you

37
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,658
obtain by using calculus and we'll be
going into that in this lecture quite a

38
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:41,318
bit more and so it's fast, exact, which is
great, but it's not, you can get it wrong

39
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:45,969
sometimes, and so we always what we call
gradient check, where we write all

40
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:48,639
the expressions to compute the analytic
gradients, and then we double check its

41
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,828
correctness with numerical gradient and
so I'm not sure if you're going to see

42
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:59,250
that, you're going to see that definitely the
assignments. Okay, so, now you might be

43
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,378
tempted to, when you see this setup, we
just want to derive the gradient of the

44
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:08,459
loss function with respect to the weights. You
might be tempted to just, you know, right

45
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,709
out the full loss and just start to take
the gradients as you see your calculus

46
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,120
class, but the point I'd like to make is that you
should think much more of this in terms

47
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,480
of computational graphs, instead of just
taking, thinking of one giant expression

48
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,369
that you're going to derive with
pen and paper the expression for the

49
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,549
gradient and the reason for that

50
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:31,689
so here we are thinking about these
values flow, flowing through a

51
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:35,509
computational graph where you have these
operations along circles and they're

52
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:38,979
basically little function pieces that
transform your inputs all the way to the

53
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:43,018
loss function at the end, so we start off
with our data and our parameters as

54
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,079
inputs. They feed through this
computational graph, which is just all

55
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:49,790
these series of functions along the way,
and at the end, we get a single number

56
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,590
which is the loss. And the reason that
I'd like you to think about it this way is

57
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,069
that, these expressions right now look
very small and you might be able to

58
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,339
derive these gradients, but these
expressions are, in computational graphs, are

59
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,250
about to get very big and, so for example,
convolutional neural networks will have

60
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,829
hundreds maybe or dozens of operations,
so we'll have all these images

61
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:12,939
flowing through like pretty big computational
graph to get our loss and so it becomes

62
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:16,858
impractical to just write out these
expressions, and convolutional networks are

63
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,370
not even the worst of it. Once you
actually start to, for example, do

64
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,509
something called a Neural Turing Machine,
which is a paper from DeepMind, where

65
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:26,329
this is basically differentiable 
Turing machine

66
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:30,128
so the whole thing is differentiable, the
whole procedure that the computer is

67
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:33,590
performing on a tape is made smooth
and is differentiable computer basically

68
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:39,519
and the computational graph of this is huge,
and not only is this, this is not it

69
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,478
because what you end up doing and we're
going to recurrent neural networks in a

70
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:45,848
bit, but what you end up doing is you end
up unrolling this graph, so think about

71
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:51,658
this graph copied many hundreds of time
steps and so you end up with this giant

72
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:56,379
monster of hundreds of thousands of
nodes and little computational units and

73
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,819
so it's impossible to write out, you know,
here's the loss for the Neural Turing

74
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:03,650
Machine. It's just impossible, it would
take like billions of pages, and so we

75
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:07,068
have to think about this more in terms
of data structures of little functions

76
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:11,710
transforming intermediate variables to
guess the loss at the very end. Okay. So we're going

77
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,318
to be looking specifically at
computational graphs and how we can derive

78
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:20,560
the gradient on the inputs with respect
to the loss function at the very end. Okay.

79
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,569
So let's start off simple and concrete. So let's 
consider a very small computational graph where

80
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:29,778
we have scalars as inputs to this graph, x, y and
z, and they take on these specific values

81
00:05:29,778 --> 00:05:35,069
in this example of -2, 5 and -4,
and we have this very small graph

82
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:38,669
or circuit, you'll hear me refer to these
interchangeably either as a graph or

83
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,038
a circuit, so we have this graph that at
the end gives us this output -12.

84
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,288
Okay. So here what I've done is I've
already pre-filled what we'll call the

85
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:51,120
forward pass of this graph, where I set
the inputs and then I compute the outputs

86
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,288
And now what we'd like to do is, we'd like to
derive the gradients of the expression on

87
00:05:56,288 --> 00:06:01,250
the inputs, and, so what we'll do now, is,
I'll introduced this intermediate variable

88
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:07,050
q after the plus gate, so there's a plus gate
and times gate, as I'll refer to them, and

89
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,800
this plus gate is computing this output
q, and so q is this intermediate as

90
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,788
a result of x plus y, and then f is a
multiplication of q and z. And what I've written

91
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:19,360
out here is, basically, what we want is the
gradients, the derivatives, df/dx, df/dy,

92
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,598
df/dz. And I've written out
the intermediate, these little gradients

93
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:30,120
for every one of these two expressions
separately, so now we've performed forward

94
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,490
pass going from left to right, and what
we'll do now is we'll derive the backward

95
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,699
pass, we'll go from the back

96
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,300
to the front, computing gradients of all
the intermediates in our circuit until

97
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,509
at the very end, we're going to build up to
get the gradients on the inputs, and so we

98
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:47,680
start off at the very right and, as a
base case sort of this recursive

99
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,670
procedure, we're considering the gradient
of f with respective to f, so this is just the

100
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,020
identity function, so what is the
derivative of it,

101
00:06:56,021 --> 00:06:57,240
identity mapping?

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,240
What is the gradient of df by df? It's one, right?
So the identity has a gradient of one.

103
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,329
So that's our base case. We start off
with a one, and now we're going to go

104
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:18,519
backwards through this graph. So, we want
the gradient of f with respect to z.

105
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:21,089
So what is that in this computational graph? 

106
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:27,089
Okay, it's q, so we have that written out right

107
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:32,879
here and what is q in this particular
example? It's 3, right? So the gradient

108
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,279
on z, according to this will, become
just 3. So I'm going to be writing the gradients

109
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:42,309
under the lines in red and the values
are in green above the lines. So with the

110
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:48,420
gradient on the, in the front is 1, and
now the gradient on z is 3, and what red 3 is telling

111
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,009
you really intuitively, keep in mind the
interpretation of a gradient, is what

112
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:58,459
that's saying is that the influence of
z on the final value is positive and

113
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:02,859
with, sort of a force of 3. So if I
increment z by a small amount h

114
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,759
then the output of the circuit will
react by increasing, because it's a

115
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,009
positive 3, will increase by 3h, so
small change will result in a positive

116
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,560
change in the output. Now the
gradient on q in this case will be

117
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:30,860
So df/dq is z. What is z? -4. Okay?
So we get a gradient of -4 on that path

118
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,599
of the circuit, and what that's saying is
that if q were to increase, then the output

119
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,740
of the circuit will decrease, okay, by, if
you increase by h, the output of the circuit

120
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,789
will decrease by 4h. That's the
slope, is -4. Okay, now we're going

121
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:48,480
to continue this recursive process through this
plus gate and this is where things get

122
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,039
slightly interesting

123
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:54,328
I suppose. So we'd like to compute the
gradient on f on y with respect to y

124
00:08:54,328 --> 00:09:00,208
and so the gradient on y in
this particular graph will become

125
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:07,179
Let's just guess and then we'll 
see how this gets derived properly. 

126
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:15,208
So I hear some murmurs of the right answer.
It will be -4. So let's see how. 

127
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:17,800
So there are many ways to derive it at this point

128
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:21,000
because the expression is very small and you can 
kind of, glance at it, but the way I'd like to 

129
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:23,979
think about this is by applying chain rule, okay.

130
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,709
So the chain rule says that if you would
like to derive the gradient of f on y

131
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:33,208
then it's equal to df/dq times
dq/dy, right? And so we've

132
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,438
computed both of those expressions, in
particular dq/dy, we know, is

133
00:09:36,438 --> 00:09:42,519
-4, so that's the effect of the
influence of q on f, is df/dq, which is

134
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:46,619
-4, and now we know the local, 
we'd like to know the local influence

135
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:52,449
of y on q, and that local influence
of y on q is 1, because that's the local

136
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:58,969
as I'll refer to as the local derivative of y
for the plus gate, and so the chain rule

137
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,019
tells us that the correct thing to do to
chain these two gradients, the local

138
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:06,139
gradient of y on q, and the,
kind of global gradient of q on the

139
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:10,948
output of the circuit, is to multiply
them. So we'll get -4 times 1

140
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:14,588
And so, this is kind of the, the crux of how
backpropagation works. This is a very

141
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:18,209
important to understand here that, we have
these two pieces that we keep

142
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:24,289
multiplying through when we perform the chain rule.
We have q computed x + y, and

143
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:29,379
the derivative x and y, with respect to that
single expression is 1 and 1. So keep

144
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,749
in mind the interpretation of the gradient.
What that's saying is that x and y have a

145
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:38,509
positive influence on q, with a slope
of 1. So increasing x by h

146
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:44,548
will increase q by h, and what we'd eventually
like is, we'd like the influence of y

147
00:10:44,548 --> 00:10:49,980
on the final output of the circuit, And so
the way this end up working is, you take

148
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,480
the influence of y on q, and we know
the influence of q on the final loss

149
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,058
which is what we are recursively
computing here through this graph, and

150
00:10:57,058 --> 00:11:00,350
the correct thing to do is to multiply
them, so we end up with -4 times 1

151
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:05,189
gets you -4. And so the way this
works out is, basically what this is

152
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,649
saying is that the influence of y on
the final output of the circuit is -4

153
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:14,649
so increasing y should decrease the
output of the circuit by -4 times the

154
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:18,230
little change that you've made. And the way
that end up working out is y has a

155
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,810
positive influence on q, so increasing
y, slightly increases q

156
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:27,959
which slightly decreases the output of the circuit,
okay? So chain rule is kind of giving us this

157
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,320
correspondence. Go ahead.

158
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:38,360
(Student is asking question)

159
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,559
Yeap, thank you. So we're going to get into this.
You'll see many, basically this entire class

160
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,259
is about this, so you'll see many 
many instantiations of this and

161
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:48,889
I'll drill this into you by the end of this
class and you'll understand it. You will not

162
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:51,870
have any symbolic expressions anywhere
once we compute this, once we're actually

163
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,639
implementing this and you'll see
implementations of it later in this.

164
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,009
It will always be just be vectors and numbers.

165
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:02,230
Raw vectors, numbers. Okay, and looking at x, we
have a very similar thing that happens.

166
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,889
We want df/dx. That's our final objective,
 but, and we have to combine it.

167
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:09,799
We know what the x's, what is x's influence on q
and what is q's influence 

168
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:13,979
on the end of the circuit, and so that
ends up being the chain rule, so you take

169
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,240
-4 times 1 and gives you -4, okay?
So the way this works, to generalize a

170
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,289
bit from this example and the way to think
about it is as follows. You are a gate

171
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:28,429
embedded in a circuit and this is a very
large computational graph or circuit and

172
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:32,250
you receive some inputs, some
particular numbers x and y come in

173
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:39,059
and you perform some operation f on them and
compute some output z. And now this

174
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:43,019
value of z goes into computational graph and
something happens to it but you're just

175
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,169
a gate hanging out in a circuit and
you're not sure what happens, but by the

176
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:50,939
end of the circuit the loss gets computed, okay? And
that's the forward pass and then we're

177
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,250
proceeding recursively in the reverse
order backwards, but before that actually,

178
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,120
before I get to that part, right away when I get
x and y, the thing I'd like to point out that

179
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,279
during the forward pass, if you're this
gate and you get to your values x and y

180
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,500
you compute your output z, and there's another
thing you can compute right away and

181
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,230
that is the local gradients on x and y.

182
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,789
So I can compute those right away
because I'm just a gate and I know what

183
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:18,009
I'm performing, like say addition or
multiplication, so I know the influence that

184
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:24,259
x and y have on my output value, so I can
compute those guys right away, okay? But then

185
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:25,389
what happens

186
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:29,769
near the end, so the loss gets computed
and now we're going backwards, I'll eventually learn

187
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:32,499
about what is my influence on

188
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:37,839
the final output of the circuit, the loss.
So I'll learn what is dL/dz in there.

189
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,419
The gradient will flow into me and what I
have to do is I have to chain that

190
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:45,278
gradient through this recursive case, so
I have to make sure to chain the

191
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,778
gradient through my operation that I performed
and it turns out that the correct thing

192
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:52,068
to do here by chain rule, really what it's
saying, is that the correct thing to do is to

193
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:56,068
multiply your local gradient with that
gradient and that actually gives you the

194
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,838
dL/dx that gives you the

195
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,739
influence of x on the final output of
the circuit. So really, chain rule is just

196
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:08,229
this added multiplication. where we take our,
what I'll call, global gradient of this

197
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:12,669
gate on the output, and we chain it
through the local gradient, and the same

198
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:18,509
thing goes for y. So it's just a
multiplication of that guy, that gradient

199
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:22,889
by your local gradient if you're a gate.
And then remember that these x's and y's

200
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:27,229
they are coming from different gates, right?
So you end up with recursing

201
00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:31,899
this process through the entire computational
circuit, and so these gates

202
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:36,808
just basically communicate to each other
the influence on the final loss, so they

203
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:39,688
tell each other, okay if this is a positive
gradient that means you're positively

204
00:14:39,688 --> 00:14:43,198
influencing the loss, if it's a negative
gradient you're negatively

205
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,788
influencing the loss, and these just get all
multiplied through the circuit by these

206
00:14:46,788 --> 00:14:51,019
local gradients and you end up with, and
this process is called backpropagation.

207
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:54,489
It's a way of computing through a
recursive application of chain rule

208
00:14:54,489 --> 00:14:58,399
through computational graph, the influence
of every single intermediate value in

209
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,158
that graph on the final loss function.
So we'll see many examples of this

210
00:15:02,158 --> 00:15:06,918
throughout the lecture. I'll go into a
specific example that is a slightly

211
00:15:06,918 --> 00:15:11,298
larger and we'll work through it in detail.
But I don't know if there are any questions at

212
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:13,000
this point that anyone would like to ask.
Go ahead.

213
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:16,000
What happens if z is used by two other nodes?

214
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:19,000
If z is used by multiple nodes, I'm going to come back to that.

215
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,537
You add the gradients. The gradient, the
correct thing to do is you add them. 

216
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:29,928
So if z is being influenced in multiple places 
in the circuit, the backward flows will add.

217
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,539
I will come back to that point. Go ahead.

218
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:53,038
(Student is asking question) 

219
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:59,139
Yeap. So I think, I would've repeated your question, 
but you're jumping ahead like 100 slides. 

220
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:03,139
So we're going to get the all of those
issues and we're going to see, you're

221
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:05,769
going to get what we call vanishing
gradient problems and so on.

222
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:10,669
We'll see. Okay, let's go through another
example to make this more concrete.

223
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:14,318
So here we have another circuit. It happens
to be computing a little two-dimensional

224
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:18,179
sigmoid neuron, but for now don't worry about
that interpretation. Just think of this

225
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:22,849
as, that's an expression so one-over-
one-plus-e-to-the-whatever, so the number of

226
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:29,000
inputs here is five, and we're computing that function
and we have a single output over there, okay?

227
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,490
And I've translated that mathematical expression
into this computational graph form, so

228
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,769
we have to recursively from inside out
compute this expression so we first do

229
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:42,129
all the little w times x's, and then
we add them all up and then we take a

230
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:46,129
negative of it and then we exponentiate
that and then we add one and then we

231
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:49,769
finally divide and we get the result of
the expression. And so what we're going to do

232
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:52,409
now is we're going to backpropagate
through this expression. We're going to

233
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:56,500
compute what the influence of every
single input value is on the output of

234
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,230
this expression, what is the gradient here.
Yeap, go ahead.

235
00:16:59,231 --> 00:17:010,229
(Student is asking question)

236
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:15,229
So for now, so you're concerned about the 
interpretation of plus may be in these circles. 

237
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:22,039
For now, let's just assume that this plus is a binary
plus. It's a binary plus gate, and we have there

238
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:26,519
plus one gate. I'm making up these gates on
the spot, and we'll see that what is a

239
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:31,000
gate or is not a gate is kind of up to
you. I'll come back to this point in a bit.

240
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:35,639
So for now, I just like, we have several more
gates that we're using throughout, and so

241
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,650
I'd just like to write out as we go
through this example several of these

242
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,720
derivatives. So we have exponentiation and
we know for every little local gate what these

243
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,048
local gradients are, right? So we can derive
that using calculus. So e^x derivative is e^x and

244
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:52,900
so on. So these are all the operations
and also addition and multiplication

245
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,040
which I'm assuming that you have
memorized in terms of what the gradients

246
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,970
look like. So we're going to start
off at the end of the circuit and I've

247
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,450
already filled in a 1.00
in the back because that's how we always

248
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,890
start this recursion with a 1.0

249
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:10,519
right, since that's the gradient
on the identity function. Now we're going

250
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:17,849
to backpropagate through this 1/x
operation, okay? So the derivative of 1/x

251
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:22,048
the local gradient is -1/(x^2),
so that 1/x gate

252
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:27,119
during the forward pass received
input 1.37 and right away that 1/x gate

253
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,759
could have computed what the
local gradient was. The local gradient was

254
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:35,048
-1/(x^2) and now during backpropagation,
it has to, by chain rule,

255
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:40,750
multiply that local gradient by the
gradient of it on the final output of the circuit

256
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,789
which is easy because it happens
to be at the end. So what ends up being the

257
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:49,349
expression for the backpropagated
gradient here, from the 1/x gate?

258
00:18:54,049 --> 00:19:59,048
The chain rule always has two pieces: local
gradient times the gradient from the top

259
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:01,300
or from above.

260
00:19:04,301 --> 00:19:08,069
(Student is answering)

261
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:12,500
Um, yeah. Okay. Yeah, so that's correct.

262
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:18,069
So we get -1/x^2, which is the gradient df/dx.
So that is the local gradient.

263
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:23,480
-1/3.7^2 and then multiplied by 1.0 which is

264
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,940
the gradient from above, which is really just 1
because we've just started, and I'm applying

265
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:34,850
chain rule right away here and the output is
-0.53. So that's the gradient on

266
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,798
that piece of the wire, where this value
was flowing, okay. So it has a negative

267
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:43,889
effect on the output. And you might expect
that right, because if you were to

268
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,850
increase this value and then it goes
through a gate of 1/x, then if you

269
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:50,939
increase this, 1/x get smaller, so
that's why you're seeing a negative

270
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,620
gradient, right. So we're going to continue
backpropagation here. The next gate

271
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:58,400
in the circuit, it's adding a constant of 1,

272
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,048
so the local gradient, if you look at

273
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:06,960
adding a constant to a value, the
gradient on x is just 1, right,

274
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:13,169
from basic calculus. And so the chained
gradient here that we continue along the wire

275
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:27,868
will be...
(Student is answering)

276
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:22,940
We have a local gradient, which is
1, times the gradient from above the

277
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,590
gate, which it has just learned is -0.53, okay?
So -0.53 continues along the

278
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:34,709
wire unchanged. And intuitively that
makes sense right, because this value

279
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,319
floats and it has some influence on the
final circuit and now, if you're

280
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,798
adding 1, then its influence, its rate
of change, its slope towards the final

281
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:46,970
value doesn't change. If you increase
this by some amount, the effect at the

282
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,548
end will be the same, because the rate of
change doesn't change through the +1 gate.

283
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:57,859
It's just a constant offset, okay? We continue
derivation here. So the gradient of e^x is

284
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:01,599
e^x, so to continue backpropagation
we're going to perform,

285
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,000
so this gate saw input of -1.

286
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,329
It right away could have computed its
local gradient, and now it knows that the

287
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:12,259
gradient from above is -0.53.
So to continue backpropagation

288
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:15,000
here and apply chain rule, we would receive...

289
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,400
(Student is answering)

290
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,000
Okay, so these are most of
the rhetorical questions so I'm

291
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,119
not sure, but yeah, basically
e^(-1) which is the e^x,

292
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:30,569
the x input to this exp gate times the chain rule,
right, so the gradient from above is -0.53

293
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:35,269
so we keep multiplying that on. So what
is the effect on me and what do I have an

294
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:39,069
effect on the final end of the circuit,
those are being always multiplied. So we

295
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:46,859
get -0.2 at this point. So now we
have a *(-1) gate. So what

296
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:50,279
ends up happening, what happens to the
gradient when you do a times -1 in the

297
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:53,139
computational graph?

298
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:57,139
It flips around, right? Because we have
basically, a constant multiply of input

299
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,038
which happened to be a constant of
-1, so 1 * -1

300
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:05,548
gave us -1 in the forward pass,
and so now we have to

301
00:22:05,548 --> 00:22:09,569
multiply by a, that's the local gradient,
times the gradient from above which is -0.2

302
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:14,879
so we end up with just +0.2 now.
So now we're continuing backpropagation

303
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,110
We're backpropagating '+' and this '+' operation
has multiple inputs here, the gradient,

304
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,599
the local gradient for the plus gate is 1
and 1, so what ends up happening to,

305
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,359
what gradients flow along the output wires?

306
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:48,089
So the plus gate has a local gradient on all
of its inputs always will be just one, right, because

307
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:53,769
if you just have a function, you know,
x+y, then for that function

308
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:58,109
the gradient on either x or y is just one
and so what you end up getting is just

309
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:03,619
1 * 0.2. And so, in fact for a
plus gate, always you see the same fact

310
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:07,469
where the local gradient of all of its
inputs is 1, and so whatever gradient it

311
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,289
gets from above, it just always
distributes gradient equally to all of

312
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:14,339
its inputs, because in the chain rule,
they'll get multiplied and when you multiply by 1

313
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:18,129
something remains unchanged. So a '+'
gate, it's kind of like a gradient

314
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,170
distributor, where if something flows in
from the top, it will just spread out all

315
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:26,560
the gradients equally to all of its
children. And so we've already received

316
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:32,139
one of the inputs is gradient 0.2 here
on the very final output of the circuit

317
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,970
and so this influence has been computed
through a series of applications of

318
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:42,450
chain rule along the way. There was another
plus gate that I've skipped over, and so this

319
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:47,090
0.2 kind of distributes to both
0.2 0.2 equally so we've already done a

320
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:51,750
plus gate, and there's a multiply gate there,
and so now we're going to backpropagate

321
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,940
through that multiply operation.
And so the local grad, so the,

322
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:02,450
so what will be the gradients for w0 and x0?
What will be the gradient for w0, specifically?

323
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,450
(Student is answering)

324
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:17,059
Did someone say 0? 0 will be wrong. It will be,
so the gradient w1 will be, w0 sorry, will be

325
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:24,389
-1 * 0.2. Good. And the gradient on x0 will
be, there is a bug, by the way, in the slide

326
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,840
that I just noticed like few minutes
before I actually created the class.

327
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:34,289
Created the, started the class. So you see
0.39 there it should be 0.4. It's

328
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:37,480
because of a bug in the visualization
because I'm truncating at 2-decimal

329
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,190
digits, but anyways, basically that should be
0.4 because the way you get that

330
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:45,400
is 2 * 0.2 gives you 0.4
just like I've written out over there.

331
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,980
So that's what the output should be there.
Okay, so we've backpropagated this

332
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:55,190
circuit here and we've backpropagated through
this expression and so you might imagine in

333
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:59,289
our actual downstream applications,
we'll have data and all the parameters as inputs

334
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:03,450
the loss function is at the top at the
end, so we'll do forward pass to evaluate

335
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,440
the loss function and then we'll backpropagate
through every piece of

336
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,450
computation we've done along the way, and
we'll backpropagate through every gate to

337
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,150
get our inputs, and backpropagate just
means apply chain rule many many times

338
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:18,220
and we'll see how that is implemented in a bit.
Sorry, did you have a question?

339
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,520
(Student is asking question)

340
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:23,021
Oh yes, so I'm going to skip
that because it's the same.

341
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:27,821
So I'm going to skip the other times gate. 
Any other questions at this point?

342
00:25:27,821 --> 00:25:32,969
(Student is asking question)

343
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:37,200
That's right. so the costs of forward and
backward propagation are roughly equal.

344
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,100
(Student is asking question)

345
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,869
Well, it should be, it almost always ends

346
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:49,500
up being basically equal when you look
at timings, usually the backward pass is slightly

347
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,000
slower, but yeah.

348
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,710
Okay, so let's see, one thing I
wanted to point out, before we move on, is that

349
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:02,350
the setting of these gates, like these
gates are arbitrary, so one thing I could

350
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:06,509
have done, for example, is, some of you
may know this, I can collapse these gates

351
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:10,549
into one gate if I wanted to. For example,
There is something called the sigmoid function

352
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:14,069
which has that particular form, so a sigma of x
which is the sigmoid function

353
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:19,460
computes 1/(1+e^(-x))
and so I could have rewritten that

354
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,650
expression and I could have collapsed all of
those gates that made up the sigmoid

355
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:27,769
gate into a single sigmoid gate. And so there's a
sigmoid gate here, and I could have done

356
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:32,440
that in a single go, sort of, and what I
would have had to do, if I wanted to have

357
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,980
that gate, is I need to compute an
expression for how this, so what is the

358
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,670
local gradient for the sigmoid gate
basically? So what is the gradient on the

359
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,470
sigmoid gate on its input and I have to go
through some math which I'm not going to

360
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,980
go into detail but you end up with that
expression over there.

361
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,750
It ends up being (1-sigmoid(x)) * sigmoid(x).
That's the local gradient and that

362
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,450
allows me to now, put this piece into a
computational graph, because once I know

363
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,819
how to compute the local gradient
everything else is defined just through

364
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:02,389
chain rule and multiply everything
together. So we can backpropagate

365
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,720
through this sigmoid gate now, and the way
that would look like is, the input to the

366
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,750
sigmoid gate was 1.0, that's what
went into the sigmoid gate, and 0.73 went out.

367
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:18,759
So 0.73 is sigma of x, okay? And now we want
the local gradient which is, as we've seen

368
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:22,559
from the math that I performed there
(1 - sigma(x)) * sigma(x)

369
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,450
so you get, sigma(x) is 0.73, multiplying (1 - 0.73)

370
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,170
that's the local gradient and then times,
we happen to be at the end

371
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:34,170
of the circuit, so times 1.0,
which I'm not even writing.

372
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,330
So we end up with 0.2. And of course we

373
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,649
get the same answer

374
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:42,220
0.2, as we received before, 0.2,
because calculus works, but basically we

375
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,480
could have broken up
this expression down and

376
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,450
did one piece at a time or we could just
have a single sigmoid gate and that's

377
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,569
kind of up to us at what level of hierarchy
do we break these expressions

378
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,339
and so you'd like to

379
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:55,829
intuitively, cluster these expressions
into single gates if it's very efficient

380
00:27:55,829 --> 00:28:59,800
or easy to derive the local gradients
because then those become your pieces.

381
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,819
(Student is asking question)

382
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:10,529
Yes. So the question is, do libraries typically
do that? Do they worry about, you know

383
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:14,058
what's easy to or convenient to
compute and the answer is yeah, I would say so,

384
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:17,480
So if you noticed that there are some
piece of operation you'd like to do over

385
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,798
and over again, and it has a very simple
local gradient, then that's something very

386
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,900
appealing to actually create a single
unit out of, and we'll see some of those

387
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:30,230
examples actually int a bit I think.
Okay, I'd like to also point out that once you,

388
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,490
the reason I like to think about these
computational graphs, is it really helps

389
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:36,289
your intuition to think about how gradients
flow in a neural network. It's not just,

390
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:39,369
you don't want this to be a black
box to you, you want to understand

391
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:43,959
intuitively how this happens, and you
start to develop after a while of

392
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,850
looking at computational graphs intuitions
about how these gradients flow, and this

393
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:52,029
by the way, helps you debug some issues like,
say, we'll go to vanishing gradient problem

394
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:55,950
it's much easier to understand exactly
what's going wrong in your optimization

395
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,250
if you understand how gradients flow
in networks. It will help you debug these

396
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,740
networks much more efficiently. And so
some intuitions for example, we already

397
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:07,609
saw the add gate. It has a local
gradient of 1 to all of its inputs, so

398
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:11,279
it's just a gradient distributor. That's
like a nice way to think about it

399
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,548
whenever you have a plus operation
anywhere in your score function or your

400
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:18,740
ConvNet or anywhere else. It just
distributes gradients equally. The max gate is

401
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,009
instead, a gradient router, and the way this
works is, if you look at the expression

402
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:30,970
like, we have. Great, these markers don't
work. So if you have a very simple binary

403
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:38,410
expression of max(x, y), so this is a gate.
Then, the gradient on x and y, if you

404
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,570
think about it, the gradient on the larger
one of your inputs, whichever one was larger

405
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,389
the gradient on that guy is one and all this,
and the smaller one has a gradient of 0.

406
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,630
And intuitively, that's because if one
of these was smaller, then wiggling it has no

407
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,220
effect on the output because the other
guy is larger and that's what ends up

408
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,009
propagating through the gate. 
So you end up with a gradient of 1 on the

409
00:29:57,009 --> 00:30:03,140
larger one of the inputs, and so that's
why max gate is a gradient router. If I'm

410
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,420
a max gate and I have received several
inputs, one of them was the largest of

411
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,550
all of them and that's the value that I
propagated through the circuit.

412
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,909
At backpropagation time, I'm just going to
receive my gradient from above and I'm

413
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:16,590
going to route it to whoever was my
largest input. So it's a gradient router.

414
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,569
And the multiply gate is a gradient switcher.
Actually I don't think that's a very good

415
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:26,960
way to look at it, but I'm referring to
the fact that it's not actually

416
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,150
nevermind about that part.

417
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,860
Go ahead.

418
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:36,650
(Student is asking question)

419
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:39,150
So your question is what happens if the two

420
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,470
inputs are equal when
you go through max gate.

421
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,150
Yeah, what happens?

422
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,470
(Student is answering)

423
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah, you pick one. Yeah.

424
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,470
Yeah, I don't think it's

425
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:57,559
correct to distributed to all of them. I
think you'd have to pick one.

426
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:01,990
But that basically never
happens in actual practice.

427
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,990
Okay, so max gradient here, I actually

428
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:13,019
have an example. So z, here, was larger
than w, so only z has an influence on

429
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:16,839
the output of this max gate, right?
So when 2 flows into the max gate

430
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:20,879
it gets routed to z, and w gets a 0 gradient
because its effect on the circuit is

431
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,360
nothing. There is 0, because when you
change it, it doesn't matter when you change

432
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,689
it, because z is the larger value
going through the computational graph.

433
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:33,100
I have another note that is related to
backpropagation which we already

434
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,490
addressed through a question. I just wanted
to briefly point out with a terribly

435
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:40,440
bad looking figure that if you have
these circuits and sometimes you have a

436
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,330
value that branches out into a circuit
and is used in multiple parts of the

437
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:47,179
circuit, the correct thing to do by
multivariate chain rule, is to actually

438
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:51,110
add up the contributions at the operation.

439
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:55,110
So gradients add when they backpropagate

440
00:31:55,110 --> 00:32:00,009
backwards through the circuit. If they
ever flow, they add up in these backward flow

441
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:04,879
All right. We're going to go into
implementation very soon. I'll just take some

442
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,700
more questions.

443
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,820
(Student is asking question)

444
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,620
Thank you for the question. The question
is, is there ever, like a loop in these

445
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,839
graphs. There will never be loops, so there
are never any loops. You might think that

446
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,589
if you use a recurrent neural network,
that there are loops in there

447
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:21,658
but there are actually no loops because what
we'll do is we'll take a recurrent neural

448
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:26,230
network and we will unfold it through time
steps and this will all become, there

449
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:30,530
will never be a loop in the unfolded graph where
we've copied pasted that small recurrent net piece

450
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,259
over time.

451
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:35,059
You'll see that more when we actually
get into it but these are always DAGs

452
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:36,338
There are no loops.

453
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:39,538
Okay, awesome.

454
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:42,220
So let's look at the implementation of how this
is actually implemented in practice and

455
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:46,990
I think it will help make this more
concrete as well. So we always have these

456
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,938
graphs, computational graphs.

457
00:32:48,938 --> 00:32:52,038
These are the best way to
think about structuring neural networks.

458
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:56,929
And so what we end up with is, all these
gates that we're going to see a bit, but

459
00:32:56,929 --> 00:33:00,059
on top of the gates, there something's that
needs to maintain connectivity structure

460
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:03,490
of this entire graph, what gates are
connected to each other. And so usually

461
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:09,710
that's handled by a graph or a net object,
usually a net, and the net object has these

462
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:13,679
two main pieces, which is the forward
and the backward piece. And this is just pseudo

463
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,929
code, so this won't run, but basically,
roughly the idea is that in the forward pass

464
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:23,759
we're iterating over all the gates in the circuit
that, and they're sorted in topological

465
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:27,980
order. What that means is that all the
inputs must come to every node before

466
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,099
the output can be consumed. So these are just
ordered from left to right and we're just

467
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:35,969
forwarding, we're calling a forward on every
single gate along the way so we iterate

468
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:39,600
over that graph and we just go forward in
every single piece and this net object will

469
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,189
just make sure that happens in the
proper connectivity pattern. In backward

470
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,620
pass, we're going in the exact reversed
order and we're calling backward on

471
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,709
every single gate and these gates will
end up communicating gradients through each

472
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,429
other and they all get chained up and
computing the analytic gradient at the back.

473
00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:57,860
So really a net object is a very thin
wrapper around all these gates, or as we

474
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,879
will see they're called layers, layers or
gates. I'm going to use those interchangeably

475
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,700
and they're just very thin wrappers
around connectivity structure of these

476
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,369
gates and calling a forward and backward
function on them. And then let's look at

477
00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:12,950
a specific example of one of the gates
and how this might be implemented.

478
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,759
And this is not just a pseudo code. 
This is actually more like correct

479
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,730
implementation. Something like this might run

480
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:23,769
at the end. So let's consider a multiply
gate and how it could be implemented.

481
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:27,690
A multiply gate, in this case, is just a
binary multiply, so it receives two inputs

482
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:33,780
x and y. It computes their multiplication,
z = x * y and it returns z.

483
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,950
And all these gates must basically satisfied this
API of a forward call and a backward call. How

484
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:42,529
do you behave in a forward pass, and how
do you behave in a backward pass. And

485
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:46,019
in a forward pass, we just compute whatever. 
In a backward pass, we eventually end up

486
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:52,639
learning about what is our gradient on
the final loss. So dL/dz is what

487
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,628
we learn. That's represented in this
variable dz, and right now

488
00:34:55,628 --> 00:35:00,639
everything here is scalars, so x, y, z are
numbers here. dz is also a number

489
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:03,639
telling the influence on the end of the circuit.

490
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:07,799
And what this gate is in charge 
of in this backward pass is

491
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,550
performing the little piece of chain rule.
So what we have to compute is how do you

492
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,550
chain this gradient dz into your inputs x and y.

493
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,550
In other words, we have to compute
dx and dy and we have to

494
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,820
returned those in the backward pass, And then
the computational graph will make sure

495
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,720
that these get routed properly to all
the other gates. And if there are any

496
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,820
edges that add up, the computational graph
might add all those gradients together.

497
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:35,650
Okay, so how would we implement
the dx and dy? So for example, what is

498
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:40,300
dx in this case? What would it be equal to,
the implementation?

499
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:49,460
y * dz. Great. And, so y * dz.
Additional point to make here by the way,

500
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,659
note that I've added some lines in the forward
pass. We have to remember these values of

501
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:57,509
x and y, because we end up using them in the
backward pass, so I'm assigning them to a

502
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,000
'self.' because I need to remember
what x y are because I need access to

503
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,949
them in my backward pass. In general, in
backpropagation, when we build these,

504
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:09,359
when you actually do forward pass, every
single gate must remember the inputs in

505
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,430
any kind of intermediate calculations that it has
performed that it needs to do, that needs

506
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:17,069
access to in the backward pass. So basically
when we end up running these networks at

507
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:20,050
runtime, just always keep in mind that as
you're doing this forward pass, a huge

508
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,890
amount of stuff gets cached in your
memory, and that all has to stick around

509
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,909
because during backpropagation, you might
need access to some of those variables.

510
00:36:25,909 --> 00:36:30,779
And so, your memory ends up ballooning up
during the forward pass, and then in backward pass,

511
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,690
it gets all consumed and we need all those
intermediates to actually compute the

512
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,000
proper backward pass. So that's...

513
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,089
(Student is asking question)

514
00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:43,189
Yes, so if you don't, if you know you
don't want to do backward pass,

515
00:36:43,189 --> 00:36:45,289
then you can get rid of
many of these things and you

516
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:49,710
don't have to compute, you don't need to cache
them. So you can save memory for sure.

517
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:54,110
But I don't think most implementations
actually worriy about that. I don't

518
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:58,280
think there's a lot of logic that deals with that.
Usually we end up remembering it anyway.

519
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:05,870
(Student is asking question)

520
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:09,369
I see. Yes, so I think if you're in the
embedded device for example, and you worry

521
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:11,949
really about your memory constraints, this is
something that you might take advantage

522
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:15,539
of. If you know that a neural network only
has to run in test time, then you might

523
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:18,750
want to make sure to go into the code to
make sure nothing gets cached in case

524
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,030
you want to do a backward pass.
Questions. Yes.

525
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:30,990
(Student is asking question)

526
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,130
You're saying if we remember the local gradients in

527
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:39,250
the forward pass, then we don't have to
remember the other intermediates?

528
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:45,269
I think that might only be the case in
some simple expressions like this one. I'm

529
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:49,170
not actually sure if that's true in general.
But I mean, you're in charge of, remember

530
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:54,950
whatever you need to, perform the
backward pass, and on a gate-by-gate basis.

531
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:58,509
You can remember whatever
you feel like. It has lower footprint and so on.

532
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:04,420
You can be clever with that. Okay, so just to give
you guy's example of what this looks like in

533
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:08,250
practice, we're going to look at specific
examples, say, in Torch. Torch is a deep

534
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,480
learning framework, which we might
go into a bit near the end of the class.

535
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,750
Some of you might end up using for
your projects. If you go into the Github repo

536
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:20,320
for Torch, and you'll look at,
basically, it's just a giant collection

537
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,580
of these layer objects and these are the
gates. Layers, gates, the same thing. So there's

538
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,429
all these layers. That's really what a
deep learning framework is. It's just a

539
00:38:27,429 --> 00:38:31,559
whole bunch of layers and a very thin
computational graph thing that keeps track

540
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:36,420
of all the layer connectivity. And so really,
the image to have in mind is all these

541
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:42,639
things are your Lego blocks, and then we're
building up these computational graphs out of

542
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,829
your Lego blocks, out of the layers.
You're putting them together in various

543
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:47,549
ways depending on what you want to
achieve, so you end building all

544
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:51,519
kinds of stuff. So that's how you work
with neural networks. So every library is

545
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:54,809
just a whole set of layers that you
might want to compute, and every layer is

546
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:58,840
just implementing a small function piece, and
that function piece knows how to do a

547
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,670
forward and it knows how to do a backward.
So just to view the specific example, let's

548
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:10,150
look at the MulConstant layer in
Torch. The MulConstant layer performs

549
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:16,039
just a scaling by a scalar. So it takes
some tensor X. So this is not a scalar

550
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:19,300
but it's actually like an array of
numbers basically, because when we

551
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,410
actually work with these, we do a lot of
vectorized operation so we receive a tensor

552
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:28,289
which is really just a n-dimensional
array, and we scale it by a constant. And you

553
00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:31,980
can see that this layer actually just has 40
lines. There's some initialization stuff.

554
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,940
This is Lua, by the way, if this is
looking some foreign to you, but there's

555
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,510
initialization, where you actually
pass in that a that you want to use as

556
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:44,630
your scaling, and then during the
forward pass which they call updateOutput

557
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:49,170
in a forward pass all they do is
they just multiply aX and return it. And

558
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:53,760
in the backward pass which they call
updateGradInput, there's an if statement

559
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,510
here but really when you look at these
three lines, they're most important. You can

560
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,690
see that all it's doing is it's copying into a
variable gradInput

561
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:03,539
which it needs to compute. That's your gradient
that you're passing up. The gradInput is,

562
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:08,309
you're copying gradOutput. gradOutput is
your gradient on final loss.

563
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:11,989
You're copying that over into gradInput
and you're multiplying by the scalar,

564
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:15,629
which is what you should be doing
because your local gradient is just a

565
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:19,980
and so you take the output you have, you
take the gradient from above and you just

566
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,150
scale it by a, which is what these three
lines are doing. And that's your gradInput

567
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,849
and that's what you return. So
that's one of the hundreds of layers

568
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:32,110
that are in Torch. We can also look
at examples in Caffe. Caffe is also a

569
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:36,140
deep learning framework specifically for
images that you might be working with. Again, if

570
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,690
you go into the layers directory in GitHub,
you just see all these layers. All of them implement

571
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,490
the forward backward API. So just to give
you an example, there's a sigmoid layer in Caffe.

572
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:51,269
So sigmoid layer takes a blob. So Caffe likes to
call these tensors blobs. So it takes a

573
00:40:51,269 --> 00:40:54,219
blob. It's just an n-dimensional array of
numbers, and it passes it

574
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:57,949
elementwise through a sigmoid function. And so
it's computing in a forward pass a

575
00:40:57,949 --> 00:41:04,379
sigmoid, which you can see there. Let me use my
pointer. Okay, so there, its calling, so a lot of

576
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,840
this stuff is just boilerplate, getting
pointers to all the data, and then we

577
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,730
have a bottom blob, and we're calling a
sigmoid function on the bottom and

578
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,829
that's just a sigmoid function right there.
So that's what we compute. And in the

579
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:18,719
backward pass, some boilerplate stuff, but
really what's important is we need to

580
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:23,369
compute the gradient times the chain
rule here, so that's what you see in this

581
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:26,150
line. That's where the magic happens
where we take the diff,

582
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:32,048
so they call the gradients diffs. And you
compute the bottom diff is the top diff

583
00:41:32,048 --> 00:41:36,869
times this piece which is really the,
that's the local gradient, so this is

584
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:41,960
chain rule happening right here through
that multiplication. So, and that's it. So every

585
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,179
single layer just a forward backward API
and then you have a computational graph

586
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:52,288
on top or a net object that keeps track of all the
connectivity. Any questions about some of

587
00:41:52,289 --> 00:42:00,849
these implementations and so on? Go ahead.

588
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,849
(Student is asking question)

589
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:04,759
Yes, thank you. So the question is, do we have to
go through forward and backward for every update.

590
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:09,259
The answer is yes, because when you 
want to do update, you need the gradient,

591
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:11,849
and so you need to do forward
on your sample minibatch.

592
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:15,559
You do a forward. Right away you do a backward.
And now you have your analytic gradient.

593
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:19,369
And now I can do an update, where I take my
analytic gradient and I change my weights a tiny

594
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:24,960
bit in the direction, the negative direction
of your gradient. So forward computes

595
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,858
the loss, backward computes your gradient,
and then the update uses the gradient to

596
00:42:28,858 --> 00:42:33,000
increment your weights a bit. So that's what keeps
happening in the loop. When you train a neural

597
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,318
network that's all that's happening. Forward,
backward, update. Forward, backward, update.

598
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:38,808
We'll see that in a bit. Go ahead.

599
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:43,808
(Student is asking question)

600
00:42:44,808 --> 00:42:47,008
You're asking about a for-loop.

601
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:51,808
Oh, is there a for-loop here?
I didn't even notice. Okay.

602
00:42:51,809 --> 00:42:57,160
Yeah, they have a for-loop. Yes, so you'd like
this to be vectorized and that actually...

603
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:03,679
Because this is C++, so I think they just do it.
Go for it.

604
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:10,899
Yeah, so this is a CPU implementation by
the way. I should mention that this is a

605
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,599
CPU implementation of a sigmoid layer.
There's a second file that implements the

606
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:19,420
sigmoid layer on GPU and that's CUDA code.
And so that's a separate file. It

607
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:22,280
would be sigmoid.cu or
something like that. I'm not showing you that.

608
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:30,349
Any questions? Okay, great. So one point I'd like to
make is, we'll be of course working with

609
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:33,519
vectors, so these things flowing along our
graphs are not just scalars. They're going

610
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:38,449
to be entire vectors. And so nothing
changes. The only thing that is different

611
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:43,529
now since these are vectors, x, y, and z are
vectors, is that this local gradient

612
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:47,530
which before used to be just a scalar,
now they're in general, for general

613
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:51,290
expressions, they're full Jacobian matrices.
And so Jacobian matrix is this

614
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,670
two-dimensional matrix and basically
tells you what is the influence of every

615
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:58,010
single element in x on every single
element of z,

616
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,880
and that's what Jacobian matrix
stores, and the gradient is the same

617
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:10,960
expression as before, but now, say here,
dz/dx is a vector and dL/dz is... sorry.

618
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:16,079
dL/dz is a vector and dz/dx is an
entire Jacobian matrix, so you end up with

619
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,130
an entire matrix-vector multiply to
actually chain the gradient backwards.

620
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:29,130
(Student is asking question)

621
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:36,380
No. So I'll come back to this point in a bit.
You never actually end up forming the full

622
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:40,119
Jacobian. You'll never actually do this
matrix multiply most of the time. This is

623
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:43,730
just a general way of looking at, you
know, arbitrary function, and I need to

624
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:46,260
keep track of this. And I think that
these two are actually out of order

625
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,569
because dz/dx is the Jacobian
which should be on the left side, so

626
00:44:49,569 --> 00:44:53,859
I think that's a mistaken slide because
this should be a matrix-vector multiply.

627
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:57,618
So I'll show you why you don't actually
need to ever perform those Jacobians. So let's

628
00:44:57,619 --> 00:45:02,119
work with a specific example that is
relatively common in neural networks.

629
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:06,869
Suppose we have this nonlinearity max(0, x)
So really what this operation

630
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:11,068
is doing is it's receiving a vector, say
4096 numbers, which is a typical thing

631
00:45:11,068 --> 00:45:12,308
you might want to do.

632
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,630
4096 numbers, real value, come in

633
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:19,630
and you're computing an element-wise
thresholding at 0, so anything that is lower

634
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:24,680
than 0 gets clamped to 0, and that's your
function that you're computing. And so output

635
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,588
vector is of the same dimension. So
the question here I'd like to ask is

636
00:45:28,588 --> 00:45:32,068
what is the size of the
Jacobian matrix for this layer?

637
00:45:37,588 --> 00:45:40,268
4096 by 4096. In principle,

638
00:45:40,268 --> 00:45:45,018
every single number in here could have
influenced every single number in there.

639
00:45:45,018 --> 00:45:49,459
But that's not the case necessarily, right?
So the second question is, so this

640
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,949
is a huge matrix, 16 million numbers,
but why would you never form it?

641
00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:54,719
What does the Jacobian actually look like?

642
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:59,019
(Student is asking question)

643
00:45:59,019 --> 00:46:02,719
No, Jacobian will always be a matrix
because every one of these 4096

644
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:09,949
could have influenced every... It is, so the
Jacobian is still a giant 4096 by 4096

645
00:46:09,949 --> 00:46:14,558
matrix, but has special structure, right?
And what is that special structure?

646
00:46:14,558 --> 00:46:17,558
(Student is answering)

647
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:20,420
Yeah, so this Jacobian is huge.

648
00:46:21,259 --> 00:46:27,420
So it's 4096 by 4096 matrix, but
there are only elements on the diagonal

649
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:33,700
because this is an element-wise operation,
and moreover, they're not just 1's, but

650
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:38,129
for whichever element that was less than 0,
it was clamped to 0, so some of these 1's

651
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:42,798
actually are zeros, in whichever elements
had a lower-than-zero value during the

652
00:46:42,798 --> 00:46:47,429
forward pass. And so the Jacobian would
just be almost an identity matrix but

653
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:52,250
some of them are actually zero. So you
never actually would want to form the

654
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:55,429
full Jacobean because that's silly and
so you never actually want to carry out

655
00:46:55,429 --> 00:47:00,808
this operation as a matrix vector
multiply, because of their special structure

656
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:04,150
that we want to take advantage of. And so
in particular, the gradient, the backward

657
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:09,269
pass for this operation is very very
easy because you just want to look at

658
00:47:09,269 --> 00:47:14,159
all the dimensions where your input was
less than zero and you want to kill the

659
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:17,210
gradient in those dimensions. You want to
set the gradient to 0 in those dimensions.

660
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:21,650
So you take the grad output here, and
whichever numbers were less than zero,

661
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:25,910
just set them to 0. Set those gradients to 0
and then you continue backward pass.

662
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:30,209
So very simple operations in the
end in terms of efficiency.

663
00:47:30,209 --> 00:47:36,809
(Student is asking question)

664
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:37,300
That's right.

665
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:45,930
(Student is asking question)

666
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:51,830
So the question is, the commication between the 
gates is always just vectors. That's right. 

667
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:55,940
So this Jacobian, if you wanted to, you can form
that but that's internal to you inside the gate.

668
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:59,670
And you can use that to do backprop, but
what's going back to other gates, they

669
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:02,870
only care about the gradient vector.

670
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:09,070
(Student is asking question)

671
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:12,070
Yes, so the question is, unless
you end up having multiple outputs,

672
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:15,070
because then for each output,
we have to do this, so yeah.

673
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:17,380
So we'll never actually run into that case

674
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:20,430
because we almost always have a single
output, scalar value at the end

675
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:24,129
because we're interested in loss
functions. So we just have a single

676
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:27,318
number at the end that we're interested
in computing gradients with respect to. If we had

677
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:30,949
multiple outputs, then we have to keep
track of all of those as well

678
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:35,769
in parallel when we do the backpropagation.
But we just have scalar value loss

679
00:48:35,769 --> 00:48:38,580
function so we don't have to worry about that.

680
00:48:40,269 --> 00:48:46,080
Okay, makes sense? So I want
to also make the point that actually

681
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:51,230
4096 dimensions is not even crazy. Usually
we use minibatches, so say, minibatch of a

682
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:54,929
100 elements going through at the same
time, and then you end up with 100

683
00:48:54,929 --> 00:48:59,038
4096-dimensional vectors that are all
coming in parallel, but all the examples

684
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:02,539
in the minibatch are processed independently of
each other in parallel, and so this Jacobian matrix

685
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:08,869
really ends up being 400 million, 400,000 by 400,000.
So huge so you never form these,

686
00:49:08,869 --> 00:49:14,160
basically. And you take, you take care to
actually take advantage of the sparsity

687
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,538
structure in the Jacobian and you hand
code operations, so you don't actually write

688
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:25,819
fully generalized chain rule inside
any gate implementation. Okay cool. So I'd like

689
00:49:25,819 --> 00:49:30,788
to point out that in your assignment, you'll be
writing SVMs and Softmax and so on, and I just kind

690
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:33,680
of would like to give you a hint on the design
of how you actually should approach this

691
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:39,769
problem. What you should do is just think
about it as a backpropagation, even if

692
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:44,108
you're doing this for linear classification
optimization. So roughly, your structure

693
00:49:44,108 --> 00:49:50,048
should look something like this where...
again, stage your computation in units that

694
00:49:50,048 --> 00:49:53,960
you know the local gradient of and then
do backprop when you actually evaluate these

695
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,679
gradients in your assignment. So in the
top, your code will look something like

696
00:49:57,679 --> 00:49:59,679
this where we don't have any graph
structure because you're doing

697
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:04,038
everything inline. So no crazy edges
or anything like that that you have to do.

698
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:07,200
You will do that in the second assignment.
You'll actually come up with a graph

699
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,509
object and you'll implement your layers. But in
the first assignment, you're just doing it inline

700
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:15,579
just straight up vanilla setup. And so
compute your scores based on W and X.

701
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:21,798
Compute these margins which are max of 0
and the score differences, compute the

702
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:26,239
loss, and then do backprop. And in
particular, I would really advise you to

703
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:30,949
have this intermediate scores that you
create. It's a matrix. And then compute the

704
00:50:30,949 --> 00:50:34,769
gradient on scores before you compute
the gradient on your weights. And so

705
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:40,179
chain, use chain rule here. Otherwise, you might
be tempted to try to just derive W, the

706
00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:43,798
gradient on W equals, and then implement
that and that's an unhealthy way of

707
00:50:43,798 --> 00:50:47,349
approaching the problem. So stage your
computation and do backprop through this

708
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:49,900
scores and that will help you out.

709
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,800
Okay. cool.

710
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:59,570
So, let's see. Summary so far.
Neural networks are hopelessly large,

711
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:01,570
so we end up in this
computational structures and these

712
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:05,470
intermediate nodes, forward backward API
for both the nodes and also for the

713
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:08,869
graph structure. And the graph structure is
usually a very thin wrapper around all these

714
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:12,059
layers and it handles all the
communication between them. And this

715
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:16,380
communication is always along like
vectors being passed around. In practice,

716
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,289
when we write these implementations, what
we're passing around are these

717
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:23,079
n-dimensional tensors. Really what that
means is just an n-dimensional array.

718
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:28,059
So like an numpy array. Those are what goes
between the gates, and then internally, every single

719
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:33,529
gate knows what to do in the forward and
the backward pass. Okay, so at this point, I'm

720
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:37,690
going to end with backpropagation and
I'm going to go into neural networks. So

721
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:40,390
any questions before we move on from
backprop? Go ahead.

722
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:51,860
(Student is asking a question)

723
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:55,530
The summation inside Li = blah?
Yes, there is a sum there.

724
00:51:55,530 --> 00:52:00,130
So you want that to be vectorized operation that
you... Yeah so basically, the challenge in your

725
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:03,130
assignment almost is,
how do you make sure that you do all

726
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:06,750
this efficiently nicely with matrix vector operations
in numpy, so that's going to be some of the

727
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,750
brain teaser stuff that you guys are
going to have to do.

728
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:14,250
(Student is asking a question)

729
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:20,030
Yes, so it's up to you what you want your gates
to be like, and what you want them to be.

730
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:22,490
(Student is asking a question)

731
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:24,490
Yeah, I don't think you'd want to do that.

732
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:30,739
Yeah, I'm not sure. Maybe that works. I don't know.
But it's up to you to design this and to

733
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:38,609
backprop through. Yeah, so that's fun. Okay.
So we're going to go to neural networks. This is

734
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:44,010
exactly what they look like. So you'll be
implementing these, and this is just what happens

735
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:46,770
when you search on Google Images for
neural networks. This is I think the first

736
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:51,590
result or something like that. So let's
look at neural networks. And before we dive

737
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:55,100
into neural networks actually, I'd like
to do it first without all the brain

738
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,329
stuff. So forget that they're neural. Forget
that they have any relation whatsoever

739
00:52:58,329 --> 00:53:03,170
to a brain. They don't, but forget if you
thought that they did, that they do. Let's

740
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:07,309
just look at score functions. Well
before, we saw that f=Wx is what

741
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:11,079
we've been working with so far. But now
as I said, we're going to start to make

742
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:14,590
that f more complex. And so if you wanted
to use a neural network then you're

743
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:20,309
going to change that equation to this. So
this is a two-layer neural network, and

744
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:24,820
that's what it looks like, and it's just
a more complex mathematical expression of x.

745
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:30,230
And so what's happening here is, you
receive your input x, and you

746
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,369
multiply it by a matrix, just like we did before.

747
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:36,619
Now, what's coming next, what comes next
is a nonlinearity or activation function,

748
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:39,710
and we're going to go into several choices
that you might make for these. In this

749
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:43,800
case, I'm using the thresholding at 0 as an
activation function. So basically, we're

750
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,780
doing matrix multiply, we threshold
everything negative to 0, and then we do

751
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:52,240
one more matrix multiply, and that gives us
our scores. And so if I was to draw this,

752
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:58,169
say in case of CIFAR-10, with 3072 numbers
going in, those are the pixel values,

753
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:02,110
and before, we just went one single matrix
multiply to scores. We went right away

754
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:05,899
to 10 numbers. But now, we get to go
through this intermediate representation

755
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:13,019
of hidden state. We'll call them hidden layers. 
So hidden vector h of hundred numbers, say

756
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:16,849
or whatever you want your size of the neural
network to be. So this is a hyperparameter,

757
00:54:16,849 --> 00:54:21,109
that's, say, a hundred, and we go through
this intermediate representation. So matrix

758
00:54:21,109 --> 00:54:24,319
multiply gives us hundred
numbers, threshold at zero, and

759
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:28,559
then one more matrix multiply to get the scores.
And since we have more numbers, we have

760
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:33,820
more wiggle to do more interesting
things. So a more, one particular example

761
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:36,330
of something interesting you might want
to, you might think that a neural network

762
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:40,210
could do, is going back to this
example of interpreting linear

763
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:45,690
classifiers on CIFAR-10, and we saw that the
car class has this red car that tries to

764
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:51,280
merge all the modes of different cars
facing in different directions. And so in

765
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:57,980
this case, one single layer, one single
linear classifier had to go across all

766
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:02,250
those modes, and we couldn't deal with
for example, cars of different colors. That

767
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,190
wasn't very natural to do. But now we
have hundred numbers in this

768
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:08,289
intermediate, and so you might imagine
for example, that one of those numbers

769
00:55:08,289 --> 00:55:11,539
could be just picking up on red
car facing forward. It's just classifying,

770
00:55:11,539 --> 00:55:14,750
is there a red car facing
forward. Another one could be red car

771
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16,280
facing slightly to the left,

772
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,650
red car facing slightly to the right, and
those elements of h would only become

773
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,358
positive if they find that thing in the image,

774
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:28,029
otherwise, they stay at zero. And so
another h might look for green cars

775
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:31,180
or yellow cars or whatever else in
different orientations. So now we can

776
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:35,669
have a template for all these different
modes. And so these neurons turn on or

777
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:41,869
off if they find the thing they're looking
for. Car of some specific type, and then

778
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:46,660
this W2 matrix can sum across all
those little car templates. So now we

779
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:50,719
have like say twenty card templates of
what cars could look like, and now, to compute

780
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,149
the score of car classifier, there's an
additional matrix multiply, so we have a choice

781
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:58,700
of doing a weighted sum over them. And so if
anyone of them turn on, then through my

782
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,269
weighted sum, with positive weights
presumably, I would be adding up and

783
00:56:02,269 --> 00:56:07,358
getting a higher score. And so now I can
have this multimodal car classifier

784
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:13,098
through this additional hidden layer in between
there. So that's a handwavy reason for why

785
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:14,720
these would do something more interesting.

786
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,509
Was there a question? Yeah.

787
00:56:16,509 --> 00:56:26,350
(Student is asking a question)

788
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:32,509
So the question is, if h had less than 10 units, would
it be inferior to a linear classifier? I think that's... 

789
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:39,509
that's actually not obvious to me. It's an interesting
question. I think... you could make that work.

790
00:56:39,509 --> 00:56:40,509
I think you could make it work.

791
00:56:43,509 --> 00:56:47,509
Yeah, I think that would actually work. Someone
should try that for extra points in the assignment.

792
00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:49,509
So you'll have a section on the
assignment do something fun or extra

793
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:53,220
and so you get to come up with whatever you
think is interesting experiment and we'll

794
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:56,699
give you some bonus points. So that's good
candidate for something you might

795
00:56:56,699 --> 00:56:59,659
want to investigate, whether that works or not.

796
00:56:59,659 --> 00:57:00,929
Any other questions? Go ahead.

797
00:57:01,329 --> 00:57:11,329
(Student is asking a question)

798
00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:13,589
Sorry, I don't think I understood the question.

799
00:57:13,589 --> 00:57:26,989
(Student is asking question)

800
00:57:26,989 --> 00:57:28,000
I see.

801
00:57:28,900--> 00:57:32,389
So you're really asking about the layout of the
h vector and how it gets allocated over the

802
00:57:32,389--> 00:57:34,989
the different modes of the dataset
and I don't have a good

803
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:39,500
answer for that. Since we're going
to train this fully with backpropagation,

804
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,690
I think it's like naive to think that
there will be exact template for, say a

805
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:46,539
left car facing, red car facing left. You
probably want to find that. You'll find

806
00:57:46,539 --> 00:57:50,690
these kind of like mixes, and weird
things, intermediates, and so on.

807
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:54,390
So this neural network will come in and it will
optimally find a way to truncate your data

808
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:55,630
with its linear boundaries

809
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:59,809
and these weights will all get adjusted
just to make it come out right. So it's

810
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:03,809
really hard to say. It will all become
tangled up I think. Go ahead.

811
00:58:03,809 --> 00:58:09,500
(Student is asking question)

812
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,579
That's right. So that's the

813
00:58:10,579 --> 00:58:14,579
size of a hidden layer, and it's a hyperparameter.
We get to choose that. So I chose

814
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:18,719
hundred. Usually that's going to be, usually,
you'll see that with neural networks. We'll go into

815
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:22,739
this a lot, but usually you want them to
be as big as possible, as it fits in your

816
00:58:22,739 --> 00:58:27,659
computer and so on, so more is better.
We'll go into that. Go ahead.

817
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:33,659
(Student is asking question)

818
00:58:33,659 --> 00:58:38,639
So you're asking, do we always take max of 0 and h,
and we don't, and I'll get, it's like five slides

819
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:44,359
away. So I'm going to go into neural networks.
I guess maybe I should preemtively just go

820
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:48,390
ahead and take questions near the end.
If you wanted this to be a three-layer

821
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:50,940
neural network by the way, there's a very
simple way in which we just extend

822
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,710
this, right? So we just keep continuing
the same pattern where we have all these

823
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:57,159
intermediate hidden nodes, and then we
can keep making our network deeper and

824
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:59,750
deeper, and you can compute more
interesting functions because you're

825
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:03,369
giving yourself more time to compute
something interesting in a handwavy way.

826
00:59:03,369 --> 00:59:09,559
Now, one other slide I wanted to flash is
that, training a two-layer neural network,

827
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:12,690
I mean, it's actually quite simple when
it comes down to it. So this is a slide

828
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:17,349
borrowed from a blog post I found, and
basically it suffices roughly eleven lines of

829
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:21,980
Python to implement a two layer neural
network, doing binary classification on

830
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:27,570
what is this, two dimensional data. So you
have a two dimensional data matrix X. You

831
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:32,580
have, sorry it's three dimensional. And you
have binary labels for y, and then

832
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:36,579
syn0 syn1 are your weight matrices
weight1 weight2. And so I think they're

833
00:59:36,579 --> 00:59:41,150
called syn for synapse but I'm not sure. And
then this is the optimization loop here

834
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:46,269
and what you're seeing here, I should
use my pointer for more, what you're

835
00:59:46,269 --> 00:59:50,139
seeing here is we're computing the first
layer activations, but this is using

836
00:59:50,139 --> 00:59:54,069
a sigmoid nonlinearity not a max of 0 and X.
And we'll go into a bit of what

837
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:58,650
these nonlinearities might be. So sigmoid is
one form. It's computing the first layer,

838
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:03,059
and then it's computing second layer, and then
it's computing here right away the backward

839
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:08,130
pass. So this is the l2_delta. It's the gradient
on l2, the gradient on l1, and the

840
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:13,390
gradient, and this is an update here.
So right away he's doing an update at

841
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:17,150
the same time as during the final piece
of backprop here where he formulating the

842
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:22,519
gradient on the W, and right away he's
adding to gradient here. And so really

843
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:24,630
eleven lines suffice to train a
neural network to do binary

844
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:29,710
classification. The reason that this loss
might look slightly different from what

845
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:33,500
you've seen right now, is that this is a
logistic regression loss. So you saw a

846
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:37,159
generalization of it which is a softmax
classifier into multiple dimensions. But

847
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:40,149
this is basically a logistic loss being
updated here and you can go through this

848
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:43,500
in more detail by yourself. But the
logistic regression loss look slightly

849
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:50,539
different and that's being, that's inside
there. But otherwise, yes, so this is not too

850
01:00:50,539 --> 01:00:55,320
crazy of a computation, and very few
lines of code suffice to actually train

851
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,900
these networks. Everything else is fluff.
How do you make it efficient, how do

852
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:03,019
you... there's a cross-validation pipeline
that you need to have and all this stuff

853
01:01:03,019 --> 01:01:07,050
that goes on top to actually give these
large code bases, but the kernel of it is

854
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:11,019
quite simple. We compute these layers, do
forward pass, we do backward pass, we do an

855
01:01:11,019 --> 01:01:14,540
update, we keep iterating this over and over again.
Go ahead.

856
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,240
(Student is asking a question)

857
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,840
The random function is creating
your first initial random

858
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:24,170
weights, so you need to start somewhere
so you generate a random W.

859
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:29,150
Okay. Now I wanted to mention that you'll also
be training a two-layer neural network

860
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:32,070
in this class, so you'll be doing
something very similar to this but

861
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:34,950
you're not using logistic regression and
you might have different activation

862
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:39,149
functions. But again, just my advice to
you when you implement this is, stage

863
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:42,789
your computation into these intermediate
results, and then do proper

864
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:46,909
backpropagation into every intermediate
result. So you might have, you compute

865
01:01:46,909 --> 01:01:54,460
your... Let's see. You compute, you receive these
weight matrices and also the biases. I don't

866
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:59,940
believe you have biases actually in your SVM and in
your softmax, but here you'll have biases. So

867
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:03,269
take your weight matrices in the biases,
compute the first hidden layer, compute your scores,

868
01:02:03,269 --> 01:02:08,429
compute your loss, and then do backward
pass. So backprop into scores, then

869
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:13,739
backprop into the weights at the second
layer, and backprop into this h1 vector,

870
01:02:13,739 --> 01:02:18,849
and then through h1, backprop into the first
weight matrices and the first biases. Okay, so do

871
01:02:18,849 --> 01:02:22,929
proper backpropagation here. Otherwise, if
you try to right away, just say, what

872
01:02:22,929 --> 01:02:26,739
is dW1, what is the gradient on W1. If you
just try to make it a single expression

873
01:02:26,739 --> 01:02:31,099
for it, it will be way too large and you'll have
headaches. So do it through a series of

874
01:02:31,099 --> 01:02:32,619
steps and back-propagation.

875
01:02:32,619 --> 01:02:36,119
That's just a hint.

876
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:39,940
Okay. So now I'd like to, so that was the
presentation of neural networks without

877
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:43,940
all the brain stuff and it looks fairly
simple. So now we're going to make it

878
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:47,740
slightly more insane by folding in all
kinds of like motivations, mostly

879
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:51,219
historical about like how this came 
about that it's related to brain at all.

880
01:02:51,219 --> 01:02:54,939
And so, we have neural networks and we
have neurons inside these neural

881
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:59,440
networks. So this is what neurons look like.
This is just what happens when you search on

882
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,800
image search 'neurons', so there you go. Now
your actual biological neurons don't

883
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:09,030
look like this. Unfortunately, they look
more like that. And so a neuron,

884
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:11,880
just very briefly, just to give you an
idea about where this is all coming from

885
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:17,220
you have the cell body or a soma as people like
to call it, and it's got all these dendrites

886
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:21,049
that are connected to other neurons. So
there's a cluster of other neurons and

887
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:25,450
cell bodies over here. And dendrites are
really, these appendages that listen to

888
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:30,869
them. So this is your inputs to a neuron,
and then it's got a single axon that

889
01:03:30,869 --> 01:03:35,839
comes out of the neuron that carries the
output of the computation that this neurons performs.

890
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:40,579
So usually, usually you have this
neuron, receives inputs. If many of them

891
01:03:40,579 --> 01:03:46,179
align, then this cell, this neuron can
choose to spike. It says an activation

892
01:03:46,179 --> 01:03:50,199
potential down the axon and then this
actually like diverges out to

893
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:54,659
connect to dendrites of other neurons that
are downstream. So there are other

894
01:03:54,659 --> 01:03:57,639
neurons here and their dendrites
connect to the axons of these guys.

895
01:03:57,639 --> 01:04:02,299
So basically, just neurons connected through
these synapses in between and we had these

896
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:05,840
dendrites that are the input to a neuron and
this axon that actually carries the

897
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:10,410
output of a neuron. And so basically, you
can come up with a very crude model of a

898
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:16,769
neuron, and it will look something like this.
We have an axon, so this is the cell body

899
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:20,909
here of a neuron. And just imagine an
axon coming from a different neuron,

900
01:04:20,909 --> 01:04:24,730
somewhere in the network, and this neuron is
connected to that neuron through this

901
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:29,840
synapse. And every one of these synapses
has a weight associated with it

902
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:35,350
of how much this neuron likes that
neuron basically. And so axon carries

903
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:39,769
this x. It interacts in the synapse and
they multiply in this crude model. So you

904
01:04:39,769 --> 01:04:44,989
get w0x0 flowing to the soma.
And then that happens for many neurons

905
01:04:44,989 --> 01:04:45,849
so you have lots of

906
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:51,500
inputs of w times x flowing in. And the
cell body here, it just performs a sum, offset by

907
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:56,940
a bias, and then if an activation function
is met here, so it passes through an

908
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:02,800
activation function to actually compute
the output of this axon. Now in

909
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:06,570
biological models, historically people
liked to use the sigmoid nonlinearity to

910
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:09,430
actually use for the activation function.
The reason for that is because

911
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:11,730
you get a number between 0 and 1, and

912
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:15,420
you can interpret that as the rate at
which this neuron is firing for that

913
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:19,809
particular input. So it's a rate between
0 and 1 that's going through the

914
01:05:19,809 --> 01:05:23,889
activation function. So if this neuron has
seen something it likes, in the neurons

915
01:05:23,889 --> 01:05:27,900
that connected to it, it will start to
spike a lot, and the rate is described by

916
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:33,139
f of the input. Okay, so that's the crude
model of the neuron. If I wanted to implement it

917
01:05:33,139 --> 01:05:38,819
it would look something like this. So a
neuron_tick function forward pass, it receives

918
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:44,500
some inputs. This is a vector and we form
a sum at the cell body, so just a linear sum.

919
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:49,980
And we put, we compute the firing rate as a sigmoid
of the cell body sum and return the firing

920
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,579
rate. And then this can plug into
different neurons, right? So you can

921
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:56,710
imagine, you can actually see that this
looks very similar to a linear

922
01:05:56,710 --> 01:06:02,750
classifier, right? We're forming a linear sum here,
a weighted sum, and we're passing that through

923
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:07,050
nonlinearity. So every single neuron in
this model is really like a small linear

924
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:11,530
classifier, but these linear classifiers plug into
each other, and they can work together to

925
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:16,650
do interesting things. Now one note to make
about neurons is that they're very, they're

926
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:21,300
not like biological neurons. Biological
neurons are super complex, so if you go

927
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:24,670
around and you start saying that neural
networks work like brain, people are

928
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:28,849
starting to frown. People will start to frown
at you and that's because neurons are

929
01:06:28,849 --> 01:06:33,650
complex, dynamical systems. There are many
different types of neurons. They function

930
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:38,550
differently. These dendrites, they
can perform lots of interesting

931
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:42,140
computation. A good review article is
Dendritic Computation, which I really

932
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:46,069
enjoyed. These synapses are complex
dynamical systems. They're not just a

933
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:49,720
single weight. And we're not really sure
if the brain uses rate code to

934
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:54,689
communicate, so very crude mathematical
model and don't push his analogy too much.

935
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:57,960
But it's good for, kind of like, media articles,

936
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,990
so I suppose that's why this keeps
coming up again and again as we

937
01:07:01,990  --> 01:07:04,989
explained that this works like your brain.
But I'm not going to go too deep into

938
01:07:04,989 --> 01:07:09,829
this. To go back to a question that was
asked before, there's an entire set of

939
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:11,859
nonlinearities that we can choose from.

940
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,559
So historically, sigmoid has been used

941
01:07:17,559 --> 01:07:20,210
quite a bit, and we're going to go into
much more detail over what these

942
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:23,690
nonlinearities are, what are their
tradeoffs, and why you might want to use

943
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:27,838
one or the other, but for now, I'd just like to
flash them and mention that there are many things to

944
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:28,579
choose from.

945
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:33,940
Historically people use to signmoid and tanh.
As of 2012, ReLU became quite popular.

946
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:38,429
It makes your networks converge quite a bit
faster, so right now, if you wanted a

947
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:41,429
default choice for nonlinearity, use ReLU.

948
01:07:41,429 --> 01:07:45,679
That's the current default recommendation.
And then there's a few, kind of a hipster

949
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:51,489
activation functions here. And so Leaky ReLUs
were proposed a few years ago. Maxout is

950
01:07:51,489 --> 01:07:54,989
interesting. And very recently ELU.
And so you can come up with different

951
01:07:54,989 --> 01:07:58,319
activation functions and you can
describe why these might work better or

952
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:01,789
not. And so this is an active area of
research. It's trying to come up with these

953
01:08:01,789 --> 01:08:05,949
activation functions that perform, that
have better properties in one way or

954
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:10,909
another. So we're going to go into this with much
more detail soon in the class. But for

955
01:08:10,909 --> 01:08:15,980
now, we have these neurons, we have a
choice of activation function, and then

956
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,259
we arrange these neurons into neural
networks, right? So we just connect them

957
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:23,140
together so they can talk to each other.
And so here is an example of a

958
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:27,170
2-layer neural net or 3-layer neural net. When
you want to count the number of layers and the

959
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:30,829
neural net, you count the number of
layers that have weights. So here, the

960
01:08:30,829 --> 01:08:35,449
input layer does not count as a layer,
because there's no... These neurons are just

961
01:08:35,449 --> 01:08:39,729
single values. They don't actually do any
computation. So we have two layers here

962
01:08:39,729 --> 01:08:45,068
that have weights. So it's a 2-layer net. And
we call these layers fully connected

963
01:08:45,069 --> 01:08:50,870
layers, and so, remember that I shown you that a
single neuron computes this little

964
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:54,750
weighted sum, and then passed that through
nonlinearity. In a neural network, the

965
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:58,829
reason we arrange these into layers is
because arranging them into layers allows

966
01:08:58,829 --> 01:09:01,759
us to perform the computation much more
efficiently. So instead of having an

967
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:04,460
amorphous blob of neurons and every one
of them has to be computed independently,

968
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:08,699
having them in layers allows us to use
vectorized operations. And so we can

969
01:09:08,699 --> 01:09:10,139
compute an entire set of

970
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:14,410
neurons in a single hidden layer as just
at a single times a matrix multiply. And

971
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:17,619
that's why we arrange them in these
layers, where neurons inside a layer can be

972
01:09:17,619 --> 01:09:21,119
evaluated completely in parallel, and they
all see the same input. So it's a

973
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:25,519
computational trick to arrange them in
layers. So this is a 3-layer neural net

974
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:30,500
and this is how you would compute it.
Just a bunch of matrix multiplies

975
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:35,550
followed by activation function.
So now I'd

976
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:40,520
like to show you a demo of how these
neural networks work. So this is JavaScript demo

977
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:44,770
that I'll show you in a bit. But
basically, this is an example of a

978
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:50,080
two-layer neural network classifying a,
doing a binary classification task. So we have two

979
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:54,119
classes, red and green. And so we have these
points in two dimensions, and I'm drawing

980
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:58,109
the decision boundaries by the neural
network. And so what you can see is, when

981
01:09:58,109 --> 01:10:01,969
I train a neural network on this data,
the more hidden neurons I have in my

982
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:05,770
hidden layer, the more wiggle your neural
network has, right? The more it can compute

983
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:12,290
crazy functions. And just to show you effect
also of regularization strength. So this is the

984
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:17,069
regularization of how much you penalize
large Ws. So you can see that when you insist

985
01:10:17,069 --> 01:10:22,340
that your Ws are very small, you end up with
a very smooth functions, so they don't

986
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:27,050
have as much variance. So these neural
networks, there's not as much wiggle

987
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:31,090
that they can give you, and then as you
decrease the regularization, these neural

988
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:34,090
networks can do more and more complex
tasks, so they can kind of get in and get

989
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:38,710
these little squeezed out points to cover
them in a training data. So let me show

990
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:41,489
you what this looks like

991
01:10:41,489 --> 01:10:47,079
during training. Okay.

992
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:53,010
So there're some stuff to explain here.
Let me first actually... So you can play with

993
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:56,060
this because it's all in JavaScript.

994
01:10:56,060 --> 01:11:04,060
Okay. All right. So what we're doing here is we have
six neurons, and this is a binary

995
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:09,000
classification dataset with circle
data. And so we have a little cluster of

996
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,520
green dots separated by red dots. And we're
training a neural network to classify

997
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:18,080
this dataset. So if I restart the neural
network, it's just, starts off with a

998
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,949
random W, and then it converges the
decision boundary to actually classify

999
01:11:20,949 --> 01:11:26,289
the data. What I'm showing on the right, which is the
cool part, this visualization, is one interpretation of

1000
01:11:26,289 --> 01:11:29,529
the neural network here, is what I'm
taking this grid here and I'm

1001
01:11:29,529 --> 01:11:33,909
showing how this space gets warped by
the neural network. So you can interpret

1002
01:11:33,909 --> 01:11:37,619
what the neural network is doing is it's
using its hidden layer to transform your

1003
01:11:37,619 --> 01:11:41,159
input data in such a way that the second
hidden layer can come in with a linear

1004
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:47,059
classifier and classify your data. So
here, you see that the neural network

1005
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:51,920
arranges your space. It warps it such
that the second layer, which is really a

1006
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,779
linear classifier on top of the first
layer, can put a plane through it, okay?

1007
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:59,939
So it's warping the space so that you
can put a plane through it and

1008
01:11:59,939 --> 01:12:06,259
separate out the points. So let's look at
this again. So you can roughly see what

1009
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:10,940
how this gets warped so that you can
linearly classify the data. This is

1010
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:13,569
something that people sometimes also
referred to as kernel trick. It's

1011
01:12:13,569 --> 01:12:19,149
changing your data representation to a
space where it's linearly separable. Okay.

1012
01:12:19,149 --> 01:12:23,079
Now, here's a question. If we'd like to
separate, so right now we have six

1013
01:12:23,079 --> 01:12:27,809
neurons here in the intermediate layer,
and it allows us to separate out these

1014
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:33,580
data points. So you can see actually those six
neurons roughly. You can see these lines

1015
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:36,869
here, like they're kind of like these
functions of one of these neurons. So

1016
01:12:36,869 --> 01:12:40,349
here's a question for you, What is the
minimum number of neurons for which this

1017
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:45,570
dataset is separable with a neural
network? If I want the neural network

1018
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:49,089
to correctly classify this, how many neurons do
I need in the hidden layer as a minimum?

1019
01:12:57,890 --> 01:13:04,270
Four? I heard some threes, some fours.
Binary search.

1020
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:08,870
So intuitively, the way this
would work is, let's see four.

1021
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:15,270
So what happens with four is, there is one

1022
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:18,910
neuron here that went from this way to
that way, this way to that way, this way

1023
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:22,689
to that way. There's four neurons that
are cutting up this plane. And then

1024
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:27,039
there's an additional layer that's doing a
weighted sum. So in fact, the lowest

1025
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:34,739
number here would be three, which
would work. So with three neurons... So

1026
01:13:34,739 --> 01:13:39,189
one plane, second plane, third plane. So
three linear functions with a nonlinearity,

1027
01:13:39,189 --> 01:13:45,649
and then you can basically with three
lines, you can carve out the space so

1028
01:13:45,649 --> 01:13:50,329
that the second layer can just combine
them when their numbers are 1 and not 0.

1029
01:13:50,329 --> 01:13:52,429
(Student is asking question)

1030
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:57,850
At two? Certainly. So at two, this will break
because two lines are not enough. I

1031
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:03,900
suppose this works... Not going to look very
good here. So with two, basically it will find

1032
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:07,239
the optimal way of just using these two
lines. They're kind of creating this

1033
01:14:07,239 --> 01:14:11,239
tunnel and that's the best you can do. Okay?

1034
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:14,599
(Student is asking question)

1035
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:25,400
The curve, I think... Which nonlinearity am I using?
tanh? Yeah, I'm not sure exactly how that works out.

1036
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:31,300
If I was using ReLU, I think it would be much,
so ReLU is the... Let me change to ReLU, and I

1037
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:41,460
think you'd see sharp boundaries. Yeah.
Yes, this is three. You can do four. So let's do...

1038
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:47,460
(Student is asking question)

1039
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:50,460
Yeah, that's because, it's

1040
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,130
because in some of these parts

1041
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:57,819
there's more than one of those ReLUs
are active, and so you end up with...

1042
01:14:57,819 --> 01:15:02,359
There are really three lines. I think like one, two,
three, but then in some of the corners two ReLU

1043
01:15:02,359 --> 01:15:05,689
neurons are active and so these
weights will add up. It's kind of funky. You

1044
01:15:05,689 --> 01:15:12,649
have to think about a bit. But okay. So let's
look at, say, twenty here. So I changed to twenty

1045
01:15:12,649 --> 01:15:16,670
so we have lots of space there, and let's
look at different datasets like say spiral.

1046
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:22,390
So you can see how this thing just, as I'm
doing this update, it  will just go in there

1047
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:32,800
and figure that out. Very simple dataset
is not... Spiral. Circle, and then random...

1048
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:39,880
so random data, and so you could, kind
of goes in there, like covers up the green

1049
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:48,039
ones and the red ones. And yeah. And with
fewer, say like five... I'm going to break this

1050
01:15:48,039 --> 01:15:54,890
now. I'm not going to... Okay. So with five... Yes.
 So this will start working worse and worse

1051
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:58,770
because you don't have enough capacity
to separate out this data. So you can

1052
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:05,270
play with this in your free time.
Okay. And so as a summary,

1053
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:10,690
we arrange these neurons in neural
networks into fully connected layers.

1054
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:14,579
We've looked at backprop and how this gets
chained in computational graphs. And they're

1055
01:16:14,579 --> 01:16:19,149
not really neural. And as we'll see soon,
the bigger the better, and we'll go into

1056
01:16:19,149 --> 01:16:23,510
that a lot. I want to take questions before I end.
Just sorry. Were there any questions? Go ahead.

1057
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:27,710
(Student is asking question)

1058
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:29,359
We have two more minutes. Sorry.

1059
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:35,710
(Student is asking question)

1060
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:36,899
Yes, thank you.

1061
01:16:36,899 --> 01:16:41,119
So is it always better to have more neurons
in your neural network? The answer to

1062
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:48,809
that is yes. More is always better. It's
usually computational constraint, so more will

1063
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:52,510
always work better, but then you have to
be careful to regularize it properly. So

1064
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:55,810
the correct way to constrain your neural
network to not overfit your data is not by

1065
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:58,940
making the network smaller.
The correct way to do it is to increase the

1066
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:03,079
regularization. So you always want to use
as large a network as you want, but then

1067
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:06,269
you have to make sure to properly
regularize it. But most of the time

1068
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:09,320
because of computational reasons, you have finite
amount of time, you don't want to wait forever to

1069
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:14,980
train your networks. You'll use smaller
ones for practical reasons. Question?

1070
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:17,780
(Student is asking question)

1071
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,980
Do you regularize each layer equally.

1072
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:25,509
Usually you do, as a simplification.
Yeah. Most of the, often when you see

1073
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:28,030
networks get trained in practice, they will
be regularized the same way throughout.

1074
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:31,030
But you don't have to necessarily. Go ahead.

1075
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:35,710
(Student is asking question)

1076
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:40,500
Is there any value to using second derivatives using
hashing in optimizing neural networks? There is value

1077
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:44,859
sometimes when your data sets are small.
You can use things like L-BFGS which I

1078
01:17:44,859 --> 01:17:47,729
didn't go into too much, and that's a
second order method, but usually the datasets

1079
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:50,500
are really large and that's when
L-BFGS doesn't work very well.

1080
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:57,039
So when you millions of data points, you can't do
L-BFGS for various reasons. Yeah. And L-BFGS is

1081
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:01,970
not very good with minibatch. You always
have to do full batch by default. Question.

1082
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:09,950
(Student is asking question)

1083
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:13,650
So what is the tradeoff between depth and
size roughly, like how do you allocate?

1084
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:16,450
Not a good answer for that unfortunately.

1085
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:20,899
So you want, depth is good, but maybe after
like ten layers maybe, if you have simple dataet

1086
01:18:20,899 --> 01:18:25,219
it's not really adding too much. We have
one more minute so I can still take some

1087
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:26,620
questions. You had a question for a while.

1088
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:31,520
(Student is asking question)

1089
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,990
Yeah, so the tradeoff between
where do I allocate my

1090
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:40,019
capacity, do I want us to be deeper or do
I want it to be wider, not a very good

1091
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:41,860
answer to that.

1092
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:44,560
(Student is asking question)

1093
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,860
Yes, usually, especially with
images, we find that more layers are

1094
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:51,199
critical. But sometimes when you have
simple datasets like 2D or some

1095
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:55,359
other things like depth is not as
critical, and so it's kind of slightly

1096
01:18:55,359 --> 01:19:59,670
data dependent. We had a question over there.

1097
01:18:59,670 --> 01:19:05,670
(Student is asking question)

1098
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:10,050
Different activation functions for different layers,
does that help? Usually it's not done. Usually we

1099
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:15,960
just kind of pick one and go with it.
So say, for ConvNets for example, we'll see that

1100
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:19,279
most of them are trained just with ReLUs.
And so you just use that throughout and

1101
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:22,389
there's no real benefit to switch
them around. People don't play with that

1102
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:26,660
too much, but in principle, there's
nothing preventing you. So it is 4:20,

1103
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:29,789
so we're going to end here, but we'll see
lots of more neural networks, so a lot of

1104
01:19:29,789 --> 01:19:31,738
these questions, we'll go through them.
